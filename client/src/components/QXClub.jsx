      <p className="text-2xl mb-3">A Culture of Possibilities:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-xl mb-4">
        <li>QX Club isn't just a club; it's a mindset. We believe that students thrive when they collaborate, bounce ideas off each other, and execute those ideas with passion. It's about turning possibilities into reality.</li>
        <li>Our mission? To infuse higher education with excitement, impact, and creativity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-2xl mb-3">Student-Led, Mentor-Guided:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-xl mb-4">
        <li>Each QX Club is a microcosm of innovation. Led by students, mentored by QuizX, these clubs become hubs of creativity, where ideas flow freely.</li>
        <li>Imagine an "Innovation Management Degree" in action—where students learn by doing, not just studying.</li>
      </ul>
